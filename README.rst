Known Issues
------------

Running your site behind a CDN may result in inconsistent IP addresses being logged.
In CloudFlare, for instance, you can work around this limitation by enabling a feature called ''True-Client-IP Header'',
but it requires an Enterprise plan.

Don't Panic
===========

Installation
------------

To enable this package in a buildout-based installation:

#. Edit your buildout.cfg and add add the following to it:

.. code-block:: ini

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        collective.fingerpointing

    [instance]
    zope-conf-additional +=
      <product-config collective.fingerpointing>
        audit-log ${buildout:directory}/var/log/audit.log
        audit-log-max-size 10240
        audit-log-old-files 30
      </product-config>

The values in `zope-conf-additional`:

  - `audit-log`: Absolute path of the audit.log logfile
  - `audit-log-max-size`: Rotate at a size of x bytes, can be 0 to never rotate.
  - `audit-log-old-files`: Keep X rotated log files on hand.

Without these lines in zope.conf `fingerpointing` will try to detect the path of the eventlog and use that one,
if that also fails it will use `./audit.log`.

After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will take care of updating your system.

Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.

Check the box next to ``collective.fingerpointing`` and click the 'Activate' button.

Usage
-----

Go to 'Site Setup' and select 'Finger Pointing' and enable the events you want to keep an eye on.

    The Finger Pointing control panel configlet.

Finger Pointing will start logging the selected events:

.. code-block:: console

    # bin/instance fg

These events are also logged in `var/log/audit.log`:

.. code-block:: console

    2016-03-01 17:31:49,678 - INFO - user=admin ip=127.0.0.1 action=logged in

An audit log view is available in the user menu to users with the `collective.fingerpointing: View Audit Log` permission:
