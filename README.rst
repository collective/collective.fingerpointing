Life, the Universe, and Everything
==================================

Finger Pointing is a basic audit logger that helps you keep record of events like user login/logout and content types objects life cycle.
All events are logged into the standard Zope log and, optionally, to a dedicated audit log file.

Other features included:

- configurable via control panel configlet
- log entries can be easily visualized by users with permissions to do so
- support for Cloudflare's ``CF-Connecting-IP`` request header to log real client IP addresses
- support for automatic log rotation based on audit log file size

Installation
------------

To enable this package in a buildout-based installation:

Edit your buildout.cfg and add the following to it:

.. code-block:: ini

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        collective.fingerpointing

By default, Finger Pointing logs audit events to the Zope event log only.
To enable logging to a separate file use the following configuration:

.. code-block:: ini

    [instance]
    zope-conf-additional +=
        <product-config collective.fingerpointing>
            audit-log ${buildout:directory}/var/log/audit.log
            audit-log-old-files 30
        </product-config>

audit-log
    The filename of the audit log. Add file name to create Finger Pointing audit file.
audit-log-old-files
    Number of previous log files to retain when log rotation is enabled. Defaults to 1.

After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will take care of updating your system.

Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.

Check the box next to Finger Pointing and click the 'Activate' button.

Usage
-----

Go to 'Site Setup' and select 'Finger Pointing' and enable the events you want to keep an eye on.

    The Finger Pointing control panel configlet.

Finger Pointing will start logging the selected events:

.. code-block:: console

    # bin/instance fg

    2016-09-26 15:24:28 INFO collective.fingerpointing user=admin ip=127.0.0.1 action=login

These events are also logged in `var/log/audit.log`:

.. code-block:: console

    2016-09-26 15:24:19,717 - INFO - user=admin ip=127.0.0.1 action=logout
    2016-09-26 15:24:28,415 - INFO - user=admin ip=127.0.0.1 action=login

An audit log view is available in the user menu to users with the `collective.fingerpointing: View Audit Log` permission:

    The Finger Pointing audit log view.

If you didn't specify a Finger Pointing audit log file name,  you'll see a warning.
However, audit events will be normally logged to the Zope event log:
